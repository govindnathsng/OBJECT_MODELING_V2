> **Date:** June 2023 - December 2023

## üìò Overview
**OBJECT_MODELING_V2** covers two projects, **Object Modeling** and **QContest**, which focus on implementing low-level design, entity relationships, and clean architecture principles. These projects were part of a structured learning experience with Crio.Do, involving practical problem-solving with real-world applications.

- **Object Modeling**: Developed a **Hackerrank-like contest application** and **JukeBox** from scratch by implementing low-level design principles and class relationships.
- **QContest**: Built an enterprise-level contest framework with services, repositories, and entity relationships, applying principles of SOLID and Test Driven Development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Object Modeling

### **Key Objectives**
- Introduction to **Low-Level Design** and **Clean Architecture**.
- **Identify relationships** between entities and design use cases.
- Implement entities, services, repositories, and commands using **Core Java** and **TDD**.
- Built **Hackerrank-like contest application** and **JukeBox** as part of learning experience.

### **Scope of Work**

#### Low-Level Design and Architecture
- Understand and apply **Clean Architecture** principles.
- Design entities and relationships for real-world applications.
- Implement object diagrams and use case diagrams for various problem statements (e.g., **Movie Booking**).

#### Skills Used
- **Core Java**, **Clean Architecture**, **Object-Oriented Design**, **SOLID Principles**, **Test Driven Development**

#### Project Highlights
- **JukeBox**:
  - Designed and implemented a JukeBox application from scratch, focusing on entities and clean architecture.
  - Identified primary use cases, key objects, behaviors, and interactions between entities.
  - Applied test-driven development to ensure functionality and code quality.

## üèÜ QContest

### **Overview**
**QContest** is a **Hackerrank-like contest application** that allows users to participate in simulated coding contests. The project focuses on the low-level design of a contest framework, implementing services and repositories for a robust, scalable backend.

### **Scope of Work**

#### Entities and Business Logic
- Designed entities with attributes, relationships, and behaviors based on SOLID principles.
- Implemented services and repositories to manage contests, following best practices for clean code.
- Developed robust unit tests to validate functionality and ensure comprehensive code coverage.

#### Skills Used
- **Object-Oriented Design**, **Java**, **SOLID Principles**, **Design Patterns**, **Unit Testing**
